The dotfiles plugin is the start point to create something similar to <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">dotfiles project</a> for xxh.

If you like the idea of xxh click ‚≠ê on the repo and stay tuned.

The `home` directory contains the files which will be copied to xxh home directory (default `/home/user/.xxh/`) before running shell. 
The [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) directory `.config` 
will be copied to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (default `/home/user/.xxh/.config`). Learn more about [home settings in docs](https://github.com/xxh/xxh/wiki#how-to-set-homeuser-as-home-on-host).

## Note!
The plugin copy files only once during first start. It copies the files from plugin home directory to the host xxh home direcotry 
as addition and without replacing. It means if you hadn't the directory it will appear. If you have directory with files 
but without the file from plugin home it just appears.

Be carefully if you are using [non-hermetic environment](https://github.com/xxh/xxh/wiki#how-to-set-homeuser-as-home-on-host) by using `+hhh '~' +hhx '~'` arguments.
